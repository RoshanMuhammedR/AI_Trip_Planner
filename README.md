> Developed an AI-powered trip planner that generates personalized travel itineraries based on user input such as destination, number of days, budget (cheap, moderate, luxury), and group type (solo, couple, family, friends). The application sends this data to the Google Gemini API, which returns a structured JSON response containing hotel recommendations and a day-wise itinerary. Each location in the itinerary is processed using the Google Places API to fetch accurate place details, which are then passed to the Google Images API to visually enhance the itinerary with relevant images. Users can authenticate using Google OAuth, and previously planned trips are saved and accessible for future reference, providing a seamless and visually rich travel planning experience.
